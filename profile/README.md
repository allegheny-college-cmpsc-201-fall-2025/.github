# CMPSC 201: Programming Languages (Fall 2025)

> A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming
language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and
implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance,
and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities
that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles
and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and
efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students use
state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to
use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## Office Hours

Given the relatively small population of our course, appointments will not be
necessary; i.e., **all office hours are walk-in only**. That means first come,
first serve.

| Day | Time          |

| Wed | 5p - 6p       |
| Fri | 6p - 8p       |

## Textbook: *Crafting Interpreters*

No textbook purchases are required for this course. Rather, this course utilizes
content from the first ten chapters of Robert Nystrom's
[*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html), which
is available for free in a webbook format.

## Current Week Deliverables (11/3)

- **Discord Discussion:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, post a novel insight
  (meaning something that one of your peers has not already shared) to this
  week's Discord thread regarding code snippets from chapter nine

- **Team Deliverable:** *by Thursday @ 12:14pm*, submit a project charter for
  next week's build project which includes:

  - Role assignments: one captain (responsible for the `project-charter.md`
    file) and two presenters (responsible for the `project-reflection.md`)

  - At least two intermediate deadlines per team member; each deadline should
    note the specific individuals responsible for the deadline as well as the
    date the task should be achieved by

  - A performance review schedule noting who is being reviewed on which days
    next week, based on this cadence:

    - 3/4 team members on Monday (3 for Cooler, 4 for Fornite)

    - 2 team members on Tuesday

    - 1 team member on Thursday

  - The selection of three interpreter add-ons: one related to enhancing current
    functionality, one related to more robust error handling, and one related to
    an entirely new lox feature

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Thursday @ 12:14pm*, complete a brief write-up
  (no more than 500 words) that gives a high-level summary of how the lox
  interpreter is implemented; this should be in `.md` and share a single file
  with a rendered image of your finalized map to be used in next week's
  performance review session

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a Markdown (`.md`) file (no other file types will be counted)
  with a 200 word (minimum) response to the following prompt:
  
  > If you could make any one change to the course to make it more instructive
  > for you, what would it be? Why?

- **Mapmaking Task:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a `.png` image file (no other file types will be counted)
  exported from [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that finalizes the
  semester-long mapmaking project by doing the following:

  - Adding at least one entity related to content from chapter 9

  - Ensuring that *all* entities are connected (no separated components) and
    that the relationships between them are explicitly defined

- **NOTE**: the individual deliverable and mapmaking task for this week will
  serve as the foundation for next week's performance review; failure to
  complete these will result in missed points for the performance review session
