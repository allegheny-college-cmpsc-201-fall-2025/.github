# CMPSC 201: Programming Languages (Fall 2025)

> A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming
language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and
implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance,
and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities
that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles
and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and
efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students use
state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to
use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## Office Hours

Given the relatively small population of our course, appointments will not be
necessary; i.e., **all office hours are walk-in only**. That means first come,
first serve.

## Textbook: *Crafting Interpreters*

No textbook purchases are required for this course. Rather, this course utilizes
content from the first ten chapters of Robert Nystrom's
[*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html), which
is available for free in a webbook format.

## Current Week Deliverables (9/22)

- **Discord Discussion:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, post a novel insight
  (meaning something that one of your peers has not already shared) to this
  week's Discord thread pertaining to the scanner we're building this week

- **Team Deliverable:** *by Friday @ 7:59pm*, have every team member demo a
  working version of the scanner from chapter four of the textbook, and ensure
  the following requirements are met:

  - Every team member must make at least one `commit` to at least one of the
    four files powering the scanner

  - Every team member must contribute at least three comments identifiable via
    initials (e.g., `// JN: this is my comment`) that either describe what
    Nystrom's code is doing or otherwise provide additional context

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, create a
  `learning-objectives` folder in your individual repository, and add a file
  `learning-objective-two.md` that contains a 500 word statement detailing
  how you've grappled with and demonstrated some level of competency with
  the second learning objective for this course:

  > Effectively use programming language constructs to design correct,
  > efficient, and well-tested programs in multiple programming languages,
  > including but not limited to Java.

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a Markdown (`.md`) file with a 200 word (minimum) response to
  the following prompt:
  
  > We've made it through 25% of the semester, and 25% of the possible points
  > have been dealt out at this point. With this in mind, take your current
  > overall score from the latest `gradebook` update and multiply your current
  > score by 4. Look at the grade conversion chart in the syllabus and determine
  > what grade that score would earn--that's the grade that you're more or less
  > on track for. Is this a grade that you're happy with? Regardless of whether
  > you're satisfied with that potential grade or not, answer these two
  > questions: a) what actions have you taken that have paved the way to your
  > current score so far? b) what strategies will you employ for the rest of
  > this semester to either maintain or pivot your current trajectory?

- **Mapmaking Task:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add an image file exported from
  [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that illustrates a high-level view of
  how the code powering this week's scanner works; this visual representation
  must include a minimum of ten shapes that illustrate the general process, and
  should also note the expected input/output of the scanning stage
