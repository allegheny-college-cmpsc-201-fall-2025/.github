# CMPSC 201: Programming Languages (Fall 2025)

> A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming
language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and
implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance,
and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities
that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles
and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and
efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students use
state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to
use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## Office Hours

Given the relatively small population of our course, appointments will not be
necessary; i.e., **all office hours are walk-in only**. That means first come,
first serve.

| Day | Time          |

| Wed | 5p - 6p       |
| Fri | 6p - 8p       |

## Textbook: *Crafting Interpreters*

No textbook purchases are required for this course. Rather, this course utilizes
content from the first ten chapters of Robert Nystrom's
[*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html), which
is available for free in a webbook format.

## Current Week Deliverables (11/17)

- **Discord Discussion:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, post a novel insight
  (meaning something that one of your peers has not already shared) to this
  week's Discord thread regarding the *why* behind our course learning
  objectives

- **Team Deliverable:** *by Wednesday @ 5:59pm*, have the instructor approve a
  project proposal that includes:

  - ~100 word descriptions for the three components of the final project: a
    language grammar, a tree-walk interpreter, and a sample program implementing
    the heretofore unknown language

  - A 10 point rubric that identifies 10 distinct "yes/no" questions that the
    instructor can use to evaluate your team's success

- **Team Deliverable:** *by Thursday @ 12:14pm*, submit a project charter for
  next week's build project which includes:

  - Role assignments: one captain (responsible for the `project-charter.md`
    file and the `project-proposal.md`) and two presenters (responsible for the
    `project-reflection.md`)

  - At least two intermediate deadlines per team member; each deadline should
    note the specific individuals responsible for the deadline as well as the
    date the task should be achieved by

  - A performance review schedule noting who is being reviewed on which days
    during our final full week of class, based on this cadence:

    - 3/4 team members on Monday (3 for Cooler, 4 for Fornite)

    - 2 team members on Tuesday

    - 1 team member on Thursday

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Sunday @ 11:59pm*, add a file
  `learning-objective-one.md` to your `learning-objectives` directory that
  contains a 500 word statement **written entirely in your own words** detailing
  how you've grappled with and demonstrated some level of competency with
  the third learning objective for this course:

  > Correctly identify and describe the steps in the design and implementation
  > of a programming language.

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Sunday @ 11:59pm*, add a file
  `learning-objective-four.md` to your `learning-objectives` directory that
  contains a 500 word statement **written entirely in your own words** detailing
  how you've grappled with and demonstrated some level of competency with
  the third learning objective for this course:

  > Design, implement, and evaluate a correct scanner and parser for a
  > programming language.
