# CMPSC 201: Programming Languages (Fall 2025)

> A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming
language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and
implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance,
and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities
that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles
and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and
efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students use
state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to
use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## Office Hours

Given the relatively small population of our course, appointments will not be
necessary; i.e., **all office hours are walk-in only**. That means first come,
first serve.

| Day | Time          |

## Textbook: *Crafting Interpreters*

No textbook purchases are required for this course. Rather, this course utilizes
content from the first ten chapters of Robert Nystrom's
[*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html), which
is available for free in a webbook format.

## Current Week Deliverables (10/27)

- **Discord Discussion:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, post a novel insight
  (meaning something that one of your peers has not already shared) to this
  week's Discord thread recognizing other students' mapmaking accomplishments

- **Team Deliverable:** *by Friday @ 7:59pm*, have the instructor successfully
  demo your Lox interpreter; to accomodate this, the interpreter must have the
  following:

  - All code through chapter eight represented in the interpreter

  - At least five comments in the `Environment.java` file describing what is
    accomplished and how

  - A `README.md` file that includes instructions for compiling/running the
    interpreter, as well as sample input/output (be sure to update this with
    any changes related to chapter eight)

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Thursday @ 12:14pm*, work with a partner or
  two to deliver a 5-10 minute lecture covering your assigned section of
  chapters seven or eight--note that slides are not permitted, though you're
  welcome to leverage the whiteboard

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a Markdown (`.md`) file (no other file types will be counted)
  with a 200 word (minimum) response to the following prompt:
  
  > Address the third challenge at the end of chapter eight. Provide the output
  > produced by your interpreter, and answer all of Nystrom's questions related
  > to it.

- **Mapmaking Task:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a `.png` image file (no other file types will be counted)
  exported from [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that adds content from
  chapters seven and eight to your existing map from last week while meeting
  the following criteria:
  
  - Must contain ~10 new entities addressing the evaluation of expressions and
    statements

  - *Every* entity must explicitly articulate *how* it is related to at least
    one other entity (e.g., using text alongside arrows)
