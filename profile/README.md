# CMPSC 201: Programming Languages (Fall 2025)

> A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming
language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and
implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance,
and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities
that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles
and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and
efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students use
state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to
use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## Office Hours

Given the relatively small population of our course, appointments will not be
necessary; i.e., **all office hours are walk-in only**. That means first come,
first serve.

| Day | Time          |

## Textbook: *Crafting Interpreters*

No textbook purchases are required for this course. Rather, this course utilizes
content from the first ten chapters of Robert Nystrom's
[*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html), which
is available for free in a webbook format.

## Current Week Deliverables (9/29)

- **Discord Discussion:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, post a novel insight
  (meaning something that one of your peers has not already shared) to this
  week's Discord thread about rules for breakfast

- **Team Deliverable:** *by Monday @ 3:59pm*, participate in our in-class
  activity around teaching context-free grammars (if you miss this class
  session, you can use a token and come to my office hours to have a one-on-one
  conversation about context-free grammars for the point)

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, write a series of (at least 25) rules for an activity in the style
  of a language grammar like Nystrom's breakfast rules; be sure to write them in
  the style of 5.1.2's condensed notation within a Markdown (`.md`) file (no
  other file types will be counted); additionally, be prepared to share them in
  class on Thursday

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a Markdown (`.md`) file (no other file types will be counted)
  with a 200 word (minimum) response to the following prompt:
  
  > Read this TIME article about
  > [AI use in the classroom](https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/)
  > and briefly highlight your take-aways. What strategies will you employ in
  > this course to use AI in such a way that your learning is safeguarded?

- **Mapmaking Task:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a `.png` image file (no other file types will be counted)
  exported from [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that visualizes the
  generalized mechanics of how a programming language is interpeted; these
  mechanics should tie back to your map for last week about scanning (that is,
  don't clear your canvas); additionally, this time there are no requirements
  around number of entities used, but credit will only be given to those that
  comprehensively present a general understanding of how language grammars
  "work"
