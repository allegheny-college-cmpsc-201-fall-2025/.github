# CMPSC 201: Programming Languages (Fall 2025)

> A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming
language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and
implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance,
and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities
that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles
and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and
efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students use
state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to
use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## Office Hours

Given the relatively small population of our course, appointments will not be
necessary; i.e., **all office hours are walk-in only**. That means first come,
first serve.

| Day | Time          |

## Textbook: *Crafting Interpreters*

No textbook purchases are required for this course. Rather, this course utilizes
content from the first ten chapters of Robert Nystrom's
[*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html), which
is available for free in a webbook format.

## Current Week Deliverables (10/13)

- **Tree-Walk Linter:** for up to five possible points, work with your team to
  successfully demonstrate a linter that can take a source code input and report
  on style breaches based on five distinct linting rules; one point each will be
  awarded for meeting the following criteria:

  - Demonstrates clear use of the Python `ast` module in achieving the objective

  - Successfully reads in a source code file as an input and reports *where* the
    problem(s) were and *what* rule(s) were breached

  - Does not break when being presented/demoed

  - Clearly shows the ability to catch all five selected linting rule cases

  - Is presented alongside extemporaneous discussion stemming from the
    highlights of the `project-reflection.md` file that addresses the following
    questions:

    - How did the `ast` module assist in this endeavor? (~250 words)

    - Would this have been possible without the use of an AST? If so, would the
      alternative approach be more/less effective? If not, *why*? (~250 words)

    - What obstacles did your team encounter while implementing this project,
      and how did you overcome them? (~250 words)

- **Performance Review:** for up to five possible points, engage with the
  instructor in a one-on-one conversation during your scheduled session about
  your performance thus far in the semester:

    - Three points will be derived from responding to high-level questions about
      the topics covered in commit weeks four, five, and six

    - Two points will be derived from feedback provided by your peers regarding
      your contributions to team-based deliverables
