# CMPSC 201: Programming Languages (Fall 2025)

> A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming
language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and
implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance,
and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities
that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles
and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and
efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students use
state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to
use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## Office Hours

Given the relatively small population of our course, appointments will not be
necessary; i.e., **all office hours are walk-in only**. That means first come,
first serve.

| Day | Time          |

## Textbook: *Crafting Interpreters*

No textbook purchases are required for this course. Rather, this course utilizes
content from the first ten chapters of Robert Nystrom's
[*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html), which
is available for free in a webbook format.

## Current Week Deliverables (10/20)

- **Discord Discussion:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, post a novel insight
  (meaning something that one of your peers has not already shared) to this
  week's Discord thread about looking back over lessons learned this semester

- **Team Deliverable:** *by Friday @ 7:59pm*, have the instructor successfully
  demo your Lox interpreter; to accomodate this, the interpreter must have the
  following:

  - All code through chapter 7 represented in the interpreter

  - At least 10 comments in the `Interpreter.java` file describing what is
    accomplished and how

  - A `README.md` file that includes instructions for compiling/running the
    interpreter, as well as sample input/output

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, add a file
  `learning-objective-three.md` to your `learning-objectives` directory that
  contains a 500 word statement **written entirely in your own words** detailing
  how you've grappled with and demonstrated some level of competency with
  the third learning objective for this course:

  > Interpret and use an existing programming language grammar.

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a Markdown (`.md`) file (no other file types will be counted)
  with a 200 word (minimum) response to the following prompt:
  
  > Look back on what we've covered so far. Identify one outstanding question
  > you have related to any topics covered thus far...and look into possible
  > answers! Be sure to cite at least two sources that address this question.

- **Mapmaking Task:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a `.png` image file (no other file types will be counted)
  exported from [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that "cleans up" and
  condenses the maps covering content from chapters four, five, and six while
  accomplishing the following:
  
  - Must include five entities from Nystrom's map at the beginning of chapter
    two

  - Must contain 15-20 entities total

  - *Every* entity must explicitly articulate *how* it is related to at least
    one other entity (e.g., using text alongside arrows)
