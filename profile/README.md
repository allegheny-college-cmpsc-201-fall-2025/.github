# CMPSC 201: Programming Languages (Fall 2025)

> A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming
language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and
implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance,
and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities
that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles
and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and
efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students use
state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to
use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## Office Hours

Given the relatively small population of our course, appointments will not be
necessary; i.e., **all office hours are walk-in only**. That means first come,
first serve.

## Textbook: *Crafting Interpreters*

No textbook purchases are required for this course. Rather, this course utilizes
content from the first ten chapters of Robert Nystrom's
[*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html), which
is available for free in a webbook format.

## Current Week Deliverables (11/10)

- **Lox Interpreter 2.0:** for up to five possible points, work with your team
  to successfully demonstrate a lox interpreter that implements conditional
  logic and functions, as well as four drafted additional features wherein each
  feature:

  - Does not break when being presented/demoed

  - Is demonstrated using either REPL-style inputs or prepared source code file
    inputs

  - Is demonstrated alongside a brief review of the new code relevant to the
    feature

  - Is presented alongside extemporaneous discussion stemming from the
    highlights of the `project-reflection.md` file, which should contain ~200
    words per drafted feature addressing the following:

    - What was the generalized strategy for implementing the feature?

    - Was implementing this feature easier/harder than anticipated? How so?

    - What do you think Nystrom was trying to teach us by tasking us with this
      challenge?

- **Performance Review:** for up to five possible points, engage with the
  instructor in a one-on-one conversation during your scheduled session
  discussing your culminating mapmaking task and the lox interpreter write-up
